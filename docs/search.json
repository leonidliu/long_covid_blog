    "text": "When I got infected with Covid this May, I told myself, I probably won’t get Long Covid.\nAt that point in the pandemic, Long Covid was what I was afraid of. After all, as a generally-healthy, triple-vaccinated person, I didn’t have to be too worried about severe acute illness or death. It was the one in five chance of not recovering — and the possibility of becoming disabled — that scared me.\nBut I reassured myself that at least I was lucky to not have known risk factors: I wasn’t unvaccinated, female, or diabetic. In my teenage years, I had avoided contracting a virus like the one that causes mono, which Covid can reactivate even years later.\nNot only that, I probably got a reduced viral load due to wearing my KN95 mask, and I managed to get access to a full course of the antiviral medication Paxlovid, which current research says slightly reduces the chance of Long Covid.\nBut months later, here I am, sick and disabled with the very condition I tried so hard to avoid.\nHerein lies a puzzle: was it pure bad luck? Or was there something about my otherwise-good health that could’ve contributed to my developing a debilitating medical condition? This is an important question — not as a matter of self-blame, but because I know firsthand that the Covid pandemic is not over, no matter what President Biden has said. As long as I can get reinfected, my Long Covid could get worse, or I could recover and get it again."

    "section": "Enter, the Dysbiosis Hypothesis",
    "text": "Enter, the Dysbiosis Hypothesis\nI may never know exactly why I got Long Covid, but I’ve read enough science to have a hypothesis. It has to do with my gut microbiome.\nToday, researchers know that the gut microbiome — the collection of trillions of microbes and bacteria living inside of the human gut — plays a major role in our overall health and well-being. An estimated 70-80% of the human immune system is located in the gut. And beyond the immune system, it also influences countless other aspects of our health, such as our mood, nervous system, and weight.\n\n\n\n“Beneficial Gut Bacteria” by National Institutes of Health (NIH) is licensed under CC BY-NC 2.0.\n\n\nStudies have shown that patients with Long Covid are much more likely to have dysbiosis, a disrupted and out-of-balance gut microbiome, than patients who have recovered from Covid more quickly. For instance, one study found that Long Covid patients specifically tend to have less concentration of Bifidobacterium pseudocatenulatum and Faecalibacterium prausnitzii, beneficial bacteria species linked to better immunity.\nIn the nine months before my infection, I unfortunately had to take several rounds of antibiotics. Five, in fact: two for tonsillitis, one for strep throat, one for gonorrhea, and one after I was so tired of tonsil problems that I got them removed. With so much antibiotic usage in so short a period of time, it’d be surprising if my gut microbiome wasn’t out of balance. Sadly, I didn’t have too much of a choice. Antibiotics are prescribed so often because they work.\nIn short, my dysbiosis hypothesis is this: my gut microbiome hadn’t yet healed from several rounds of antibiotics, and Long Covid resulted from the virus taking advantage of my temporarily vulnerable gut. Taken further, the virus might even have found a way to take up residence in the relatively hospitable environment that is the gut. The virus and viral fragments have been found within the gut tissue of infected people, which is one reason why viral persistence has become a prevailing theory of why some people suffer from Long Covid."

    "text": "Data\nSuspecting dysbiosis, I ordered a commercial microbiome test from the company Ombre to better understand the health of my gut microbiome.\nThe test cost $100 and was surprisingly easy to self-administer. Describing the process would be more graphic than I care to do online, but let’s just say it involved a swab, a test tube, and used toilet paper. I sent in my sample and got my results back within two weeks.\n\n\n\nResults from my microbiome test; analysis by Biomesight. Sep 2022.\n\n\nShown above are estimated concentrations of my good bacterial genera from my sample. Of seven measured genera, the free-of-cost analysis by Biomesight categorized me as “low” on six. Two in particular — Akkermansia (which plays a role in strengthening the gut lining to prevent leakage) and Bifidobacterium (which plays a role in modulating the body’s immune responses) — appeared nonexistent or nearly so, at estimated concentrations of 0.000% and 0.002% respectively.\nYikes!\nHow about the two beneficial strains in the aforementioned study on patients with Long Covid? Well, Faecalibacterium prausnitzii was detected at the low concentration of 2.879% and Bifidobacterium pseudocatenulatum was not detected at all.\nDouble yikes!\nNot shown are the concentrations of my bad bacterial genera, mostly because they also appeared low. That was good news, at least.\nNow, I don’t know how accurate these commercial tests are, or what research may back the presented interval ranges, but between my antibiotic history and these results, it feels safe to say that I am currently experiencing some form of dysbiosis. With low levels of important beneficial bacteria, I’d guess that my gut is (still) vulnerable to opportunistic infections. Rebuilding these populations seems to me a no-brainer in my journey to restored health — and perhaps even toward full recovery."

    "text": "What I’m trying\nMany (but not all) of the interventions below are suggested by the pioneering research of Stanford microbiologists Erica and Justin Sonnenburg. They detail some of them in their published book, The Good Gut, and another is suggested by a recent study they collaborated on showing durable benefits to the microbiome as a result of increased fermented food intake.\n\nEating several servings of fermented food every day. For me, this includes a daily glass of homemade kefir, a fermented milk drink similar to yogurt, as well more kimchi, sauerkraut, and miso in general.\nEating a wider range of fruits and vegetables, and eating less red meat. Especially foods that are vibrant and colorful.\nSupplementing with probiotics and prebiotics. For example, Garden of Life has several formulations of probiotics (live good bacteria) containing high Bifido counts, as well as prebiotics (which help good bacterial populations thrive).\nSpending time in nature and with dogs, when I can. Both are good ways to expose myself to healthy bacteria, and good for my mental health, too. Since I live in DC, this sometimes means dogs and Rock Creek Park!\nDrinking more bone broth. Not mentioned by the Sonnenbergs, but is nonetheless supposedly helpful for repairing the lining of the gut.\n\nOutside of my early Paxlovid course, I haven’t tried any antivirals that might combat viral persistence, should viral persistence explain my condition, though perhaps I will in the future.\nIn the future, I may also see if an integrative medicine doctor can offer me more targeted guidance."

I’m craving the tangy flavor of fermented food more than ever before. I especially think my life has been improved by the addition of homemade kefir, which I tell my friends is “the champagne of milk” for it’s fun, luscious fizziness.\nAs for the cheapest way to assess my gut health from week to week, you’ll just have to trust me when I say that my stool frequency and consistency have improved, too. Google “Bristol Stool Chart,” if you’re interested in more on that. It’s a real medical tool.\nBeyond that, I plan to retake the Ombre test in another month or two for comparison."

    "text": "Hello, and welcome to my blog! My name is Leo, and I’m 30 years old. Since June 23, 2022, I’ve been struggling with Long Covid.\nBefore my first Covid infection this year, I was a triple-vaccinated, healthy, and happy guy living in Washington, DC. I was doing work I found meaningful, dating as a young gay man, and socially active. Physically, I enjoyed biking, hiking, lifting weights, and often packed my social calendar back-to-back without worry or consequence.\n\n\n\nA picture of me wearing a face mask, with my friend’s dog Walden\n\n\nBut for over four months now, I’ve struggled with a relatively new medical condition that has drastically changed the quality of my life. These days, I’m unable to work full-time, rarely leave my apartment, and can’t easily take care of myself. I rely a lot on my wonderful friends and community for rides, companionship, help around the house, and other forms of regular care. Although my doctors are kind, I often leave medical appointments feeling like they didn’t have much to offer, with the root cause of my condition unidentified and approved treatments potentially still years away.\nI’m starting this blog to have a place to chronicle the ups and downs of my journey with Long Covid when I can. I hope it can be a place where I can organize the myriad information I consume about Long Covid and its effects on virtually all organ systems of the body, document the results of mini self-experiments in recovery while navigating a condition with no approved treatments, try to uncover what’s going on in my body, and share about the challenging mental and emotional aspects of living with a medical condition that’s left me quite disabled for now.\nPerhaps through the process of writing – organizing, fact-checking, separating evidence from theory, and fact from feeling – I can cultivate a greater sense of patience about the journey I’m on and more fully own the story of my illness. I hope it can help my healing journey along, and maybe even the healing journeys of others suffering from conditions similar to mine.\nTo those interested in my journey, welcome and thank you for following along! To my fellow long haulers, I’m really happy you’re here – and I believe we will get through this somehow."

    "text": "It wasn’t until about three months into my Long Covid that I began to have trouble with my heart rate.\nI was having a good month by the standards of my new medical condition, so I took the opportunity to try to squeeze in a haircut. I was still trying to be careful — not wanting another episode of post-exertional malaise (PEM), a subject for a future blog post — so I took an electric scooter to and from the barbershop, fifteen minutes away.\nI thought my body could handle an electric scooter ride. After all, at this point in my recovery, I was doing a daily 15-20 minute walk, albeit with a break every five minutes. And I’d taken shorter scooter trips a few times without incident.\nBut partway through the trip, I noticed on my FitBit that my heart rate had shot up to 130 beats per minute. A full 60 higher than my resting heart rate of 70. As far as I could tell, just from standing and balancing on the electric scooter on a warm day.\nUh oh, that’s not normal.\nAt the barbershop, I noticed malaise setting in as my haircut proceeded. The feeling of being sick and mildly poisoned crept down my head and neck. With the barber making small talk, my ability to hold conversation quickly diminished."

    "text": "Fast forward, nearly two months later\nSeemingly starting with the scooter incident, elevated heart rate has now become a way of life. Rarely does five minutes of being upright pass without me checking the heart rate reading on my wrist at least once.\nFor much of the last two months, I have been horizontal on my couch or bed, the only apparent position in which my heart rate cannot make me sicker. After the scooter ride left me feeling worse for about 5 weeks, I am still too scared to resume daily walks — not wanting to inadvertantly push too far again.\nI’ve also since been diagnosed by a cardiologist with POTS, or at least something like it. POTS stands for Postural Orthostatic Tachychardia Syndrome, and it’s a common co-morbidity among those of us who haven’t recovered from Covid. POTS is a nervous system dysfunction that makes the body unable to comfortably tolerate being upright. As I had experienced, it typically shows up through elevated heart rate and a complex constellation of potential symptoms. The root cause is unknown and probably heterogeneous, though it commonly starts after viral infections. Like with many other post-viral conditions, there is no medically-approved cure at this point."

    "text": "Data\nTo meet the diagnostic criteria for POTS, you need to have a heart rate that jumps 30 beats per minute upon standing. You also need to rule out that the increase in heart rate coincides with changes in your blood pressure, such as a drop in blood pressure that could cause elevated heart rate.\nI demonstrated to my cardiologist that I met the criteria using a test called the (unfortunately named) Poor Man’s Tilt Test. Below are data from four days of heart rate and blood pressure readings I took using a standard blood pressure cuff, first thing in the morning. Looking at the results, it wasn’t unusual for my heart rate to increase by over 40 upon standing. Such an increase is large, since even an increase of 20 is considered orthostatic intolerance. Meanwhile, my blood pressure readings were generally stable. So, POTS.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStill, I’d say that I am presenting on the milder-to-moderate side of POTS, at least for now. Far too many people with POTS are fully unable to leave their beds for months at a time, and I’ve heard reports of people whose heart rate can jump to 170 just after standing up."

It can also help people with POTS — often, I’m told, without as many side effects as beta blockers.\nI drink 2-3 liters of water a day to boost blood volume. Once a day, I mix a liter of water with a packet of Triorial, which uses a World Health Organization-approved oral rehydration formula that includes over 2,600 mg of salt per packet to help my body retain hydration.\nAlso, I am at the very beginning of trying a particular physical rehabilitation program — a modified version of the CHOP protocol for POTS — designed by a Long Covid POTS patient with for those recovering from similar conditions. The program starts with five minutes of horizontal exercise every other day, with a break after every minute of exercise during which I wait for my heart rate to fall back down. If it doesn’t, then I stop for the day.\nIn addition, I am trying to add more ‘exercises’ that I have heard can be helpful in regulating the nervous system: adding cold water exposure to the end of my showers, breathing exercises (e.g., STASIS breathing), and meditation.\nLastly, I got the Pfizer bivalent booster a few weeks ago. While everyone’s reaction is a little different, particularly for those with Long Covid, some people do report general improvement after getting a vaccine, which is why I consider it a potential POTS intervention."

If I were to experience another flare-up or “crash,” as some of us call them, I might find myself mostly horizontal for weeks again. Nevertheless, right now I am hopeful that, with my intentional POTS-informed physical rehabilitation program and limited exertion otherwise, I will be able to improve without avoid triggering another flare-up or crash."
